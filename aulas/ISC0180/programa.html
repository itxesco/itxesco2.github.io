<p>Critical evaluation of the scholarly literature is a crucial skill for
researchers. Through this course (along with its continuation, BMI
882), Ph.D. students in Biomedical Data Science will develop this
valuable skill by focused reading and discussion of a variety of
journal articles of present or historical importance the biomedical
sciences literature, including biostatistics, biomedical informatics,
and relevant topics in statistics and computer science. Students will
read and discuss one article or a small group of related articles each
week. Students will provide short written summaries in advance of
discussion. In addition to the readings and discussion,
there will be two written homework assignments
related to the articles under discussion. These homework assignments
will involve an effort to reproduce the results of an article, the use
of computer simulation to investigate properties of methods discussed
in an article, or application of the discussed methods to related
biomedical data.</p>

<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Students will be able to critically evaluate quantitative approaches in the scientific literature.</li>
  <li>Students will be able to articulate the biological context of a research question and the scientific relevance of analysis results.</li>
  <li>Students will be able to identify and articulate the strengths and weaknesses of different study designs and analysis methods, including potential biases in research data sets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>The primary course activity will be discussion. Be prepared, be
engaged, listen, and be respectful.</p>

<p>I ask that everyone strive toward the following:</p>

<h3 id="course-grade">Course grade</h3>

<p>Course grade will be based on class participation (40%),
written article summaries (30%), and 2 homework assignments (30%).</p>

<p>The article summaries will be scored 0 (missing), 1 (weak), 2 (adequate),
and 3 (strong).</p>

<p>The class participation grade will be based on participation in each
session, scored according to the following rubric:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Good contributor</strong>: Contributions in class reflect thorough
preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good
insights and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well
substantiated and often persuasive. (Score 3/3)</p>

  <p><strong>Adequate contributor</strong>: Contributions in class reflect satisfactory
preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive, provide
generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the
discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well
substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. (Score 2/3)</p>

  <p><strong>Weak contributor</strong>: Contributions in class reflect inadequate
preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any
insights and never a constructive direction for the class.
Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. (Score 1/3)</p>

  <p><strong>Non-participant</strong>: Says little or nothing in class.
Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. (Score 0/3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Grading scale</strong>: 92-100 (A), 87-91 (AB), 82-86 (B), 77-81 (BC), 70-76
(C), 60-69 (D), &lt;60 (F)</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to discuss course content and homework
assignments with each other, but the article summaries and homework
assignments are to be each student’s own, separate work.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>

<p>Assigned readings appear in the <a href="schedule.html">course schedule</a>.
Students are expected to complete the reading assignments in advance
of discussion.</p>

<h4 id="written-article-summaries">Written article summaries</h4>

<p>Prior to each Tuesday morning class , write a short summary of the article or articles to
be discussed that week: one paragraph summarizing the article(s), and
a second paragraph describing your reaction (for example, aspects that
you found surprising, interesting, or suspect). The written summary
should be less than a page but more than a couple of sentences.
<strong>Also include two or more discussion questions that might be used to
stimulate discussion of the paper.</strong></p>

<p>These article summaries should be completed at least a half-hour prior
to the class meeting time. This may be accomplished in a variety of
ways. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email a PDF or text file to <a href="https://kbroman.org">the instructor</a>.</li>
  <li>Post documents to a <a href="https://uwmadison.app.box.com">Box</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, or
<a href="https://dropbox.com">DropBox</a> folder that you share with the
instructor.</li>
  <li>Post a text or
<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown</a>
document to a repository at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.</li>
  <li>Post to a blog, for example with
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
pages</a>, or
<a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the blog or repository approaches, they should be accessible to
the instructor but may otherwise be private.</p>

<h4 id="homework-assignments">Homework assignments</h4>

<p>There will be two written homework assignments related to the
articles under discussion. These homework assignments will involve an
effort to reproduce the results of an article, the use of computer
simulation to investigate properties of methods discussed in an
article, or application of the discussed methods to related biomedical
data.</p>

<h3 id="religious-observances-or-other-absences">Religious observances or other absences</h3>

<p>If you need to miss class for religious observances, or any other
reason, please let the instructor know in advance, or as soon as is
feasible, so that we can try to make some accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>

<p>By virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high
academic standards of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; academic
misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the
institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, and helping others commit these previously listed acts
are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action.
Examples of disciplinary action include, but is not limited to,
failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary
probation, suspension, or expulsion.</p>

<h3 id="accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities">Accommodations for students with disabilities</h3>

<p>The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled
students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and
UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with
disabilities be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus
life. Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities is a
shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to
inform the instructor of their need for instructional accommodations
by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible
after a disability has been incurred or recognized. The instructor
will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the
<a href="https://mcburney.wisc.edu">McBurney Center</a> to identify and provide
reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information,
including instructional accommodations as part of a student’s
educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA.</p>

<h3 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and inclusion</h3>

<p>Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for
UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the
profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status,
abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit
ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research,
